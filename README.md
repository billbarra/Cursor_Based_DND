# Cursor_Based_DND
你好！

我是一个完全没有任何编程基础的人，这个项目是我完全根据 Cursor 制作的一个库，希望通过和它对话的方式来进行单人DND跑团。

（另外其实我也没怎么玩过跑团

因为目前的 AI 跑团，大多只是利用一个 Prompt 发给 AI 后与它对话，会产生很多的问题，例如有的 AI 记不住你之前有什么装备、有什么属性，经常会出错，

有的 AI 不会使用程序来掷骰子等等操作

而且很多时候会出现平衡性的问题，比如时间久了会让游戏中的战斗比较枯燥无味

所以为了解决这个问题，我尝试了用 cursor 来进行游戏！让 cursor 自动运行脚本，记录种族、技能、装备、buff 等等各种信息，并且根据游戏进度自动调增难度和进行数值平衡

（但不确定实现的效果会如何

所以这个项目完完全全是个 demo，只是提供一种解决方案的设想，希望可以有更多的大佬能再此基础上开发出更加完备的项目！

Hello!

I apologize, but only the Chinese version is available at the moment. However, you can use Cursor to translate it into English, although I'm not sure if it will run directly after the translation.

I am someone with absolutely no programming background. This project is a library I created entirely using Cursor, with the hope of playing a solo D&D campaign by conversing with it.

(On a side note, I don't have much experience with tabletop RPGs either.)

The reason for this project is that current AI-driven RPGs, which mostly operate by sending a prompt to an AI and then having a conversation, present many problems. For instance, some AIs forget your equipment or character attributes, leading to frequent errors. Others are unable to programmatically perform actions like rolling dice.

Furthermore, game balance often becomes an issue, which can make combat tedious and uninteresting over time.

To address these issues, I attempted to build the game using Cursor. The idea is to have Cursor automatically run scripts to track various information such as race, skills, equipment, and buffs, while also automatically adjusting the difficulty and balancing the numbers as the game progresses.

(However, I'm not certain how effective the final implementation will be.)

Therefore, this project is purely a demo. It's meant to offer a potential solution concept, and I hope that more experienced developers ("gurus" or "experts") can build upon this foundation to create more comprehensive and complete projects!
